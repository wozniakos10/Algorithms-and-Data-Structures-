## Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-
<br>
Algorithms-and-Data-Structures- is a repository with a compulsory and some extra[E] exercises which I have been doing through the Algorithms and Data Structures course on 4 term of my studies. At the beginning of each script, you can find information about the score I achieved. In particular folder you are able to find consecutive files:

- Instruction.txt - File with a instruction to exercise
- main.py - File with compulsory task
- extra.py - File with extra task
